# undergraduateWork is a collection of sometimes notable and sometimes not so notable notebooks I have written. 
# It should not be taken as a demonstration of my present coding or analytical ability.
# Looking back, a lot of the code is inefficient, but these are some of my first ever projects, so that is to be expected
# I plan to begin uploading some of my graduate work soon, but this is what's here for now.
# If I draw any conclusions from looking back at my work, it's that I learned a lot in those last two years of working on coding and analytics
# ... and that I also have a lot left to learn
